## 🧠 Overview  

**OBS Studio** is a powerful Windows application designed for real-time video capture, screen recording, and live broadcasting. It is widely used by streamers, educators, content creators, and professionals who need reliable control over video and audio sources.

The software allows users to combine multiple inputs such as screens, cameras, images, media files, and audio devices into custom scenes. These scenes can be switched instantly, making OBS Studio suitable for dynamic live productions as well as high-quality local recordings.

With a focus on performance and flexibility, OBS Studio provides advanced configuration options while remaining accessible. Users can fine-tune output quality, manage audio channels independently, and adapt the workspace to match their production style.
